# hstracker-to-hearthpwn
hack to export decks to hearthpwn from epix37's badass tracker

requires python3, requests, and beautifulsoup4

if you have python v3 already, a pip install requests and pip install beautifulsoup4 should be enough

then, run ./dump-hearthpwn-map.py once to pull down the deckbuilder pages that will give us a map from
card names to hearthpwn's wonderful ID format that is different from EVERY OTHER SITE.

then you can run ./deck-file-to-deckbuiler-url.py <class> path.to.deck.txt
to generate the url.

Example using Senfglas' awesome Grim Patron warrior deck.

Create deck.txt by using the tracker's Copy names to clipboard.
